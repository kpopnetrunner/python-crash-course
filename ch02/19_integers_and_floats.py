# Intergers and Floats

# When you divide any two numbers, even if they are integers that result in a whole number, you'll
# always get a float:

# >>> 4/2
# 2.0

# If you mix an integer and a float in any other operation, you'll get a float as well:

# >> 1 + 2.0
# 3.0
# >>> 2 * 3.0
# 6.0
# >>> 3.0 ** 2
# 9.0

# Python defaults to a float in any operation that uses a float, even if the output is a whole number.
