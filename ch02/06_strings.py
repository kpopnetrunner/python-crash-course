# Strings

# Because most programs define and gather some sort of data, and then do something useful with it, it helps to
# classify different types of data. The first data type we'll look at is the string. Strings are quite simple at
# first glance, but you can use them in many different ways.

# A string is a series of characters. Anything inside quotes is considered a string in Python, and you can use
# single or double quotes around your strings like this:

# "This is a string."
# 'This is also a string.'

# This flexibility allows you to use quotes and apostrophes within your strings:

# 'I told my friend, "Python is my favorite language!"'
# "The language 'Python' is named after Monty Python, not the snake."
# "One of Python's strengths is its diverse and supportive community."

message_1 = 'I told my friend, "Python is my favorite language!"'
message_2 = "The language 'Python' is named after Monty Python, not the snake."
message_3 = "One of Python's strengths is its diverse and supportive community."
print(message_1)
print(message_2)
print(message_3)
