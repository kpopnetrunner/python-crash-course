# Multiple Assignment

# You can assign values to more than one variable using just a single line. This can help shorten your
# programs and make them easier to read; you'll use this technique most often when initializing a set
# of numbers.

# For example, here's how you can initialize the variables x, y, and z to zero:

# >>> x, y, z = 0, 0, 0

# You need to separate the variable names with commas, and do the same with the values, and Python will
# assign each value to its respectively positioned variable. As long as the number of values matches the
# number of variables, Python will match them up correctly.
