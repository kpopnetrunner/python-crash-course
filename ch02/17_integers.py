# Numbers

# Numbers are used quite often in programming to keep score in games, represents data in visualizations,
# store information in web applications, and so on. Python treats numbers in several different ways,
# depending on how they're being used. Let's first look at how Python manages integers, because they're
# the simplest to work with.

# Integers

# You can add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), and divide (/) integers in Python.
# >>> 2 + 3
# 5
# >>> 3 -1
# 1
# >>> 2 * 3
# 6
# >>> 3 / 2
# 1.5

# In a terminal session, Python simply returns the result of the operation. Python uses two multiplication
# symbols to represent exponents:

# >>> 3 ** 2
# 9
# >>> 3 ** 3
# 27
# >>> 10 ** 6
# 1000000

# Python supports the order of operations too, so you can use multiple operations in one expression. You can
# also use parentheses to modify the order of operations so Python can evaluate your expression in the order
# you specify. For example:

# >>> 2 + 3*4
# 14
# >>> (2 + 3) * 4
# 20

# The spacing in these examples has no effect on how Python evaluates the expressions; it simply helps you
# more quickly spot the operations that have priority when you're reading through the code.
