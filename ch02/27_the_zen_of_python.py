# The Zen of Python

# Experienced Python programmers will encourage you to avoid complexity and aim for simplicity whenever
# possible. The Python community's philosophy is contained in "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters. You can
# access this brief set of principles for writing good Python code by entering import this into your
# interpreter. I won't reproduce the entire "Zen of Python" here, but I'll share a few lines to help you
# understand why they should be important to you as a beginning Python programmer.

# The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
# Beautiful is better than ugly.

# Pythojn programmers embrace the ntion that code can be beautiful and elegant. In programming, people
# solve problems. Programmers have always respected well-designed, efficient, and event beautiful solutions
# to problems. As you learn more about Python and use it to write more code, someone might look over your
# shoulder one day and say, "Wo, that's some beautiful code!"

# Simple is better than complex.

# If you have a choice between a simple and a complex solution, and both work, use the simple solution.
# Your code will be easier to maintain, and it will be easier for you and others to build on that code later
# on.

# Complex is better than complicated.

# Real life is messy, and sometimes a simple solution to a problem is unattainable. In that case, use the simplest
# solution that works.

# Readablility counts.

# Even when your code is complex, aim to make it readable. When you're working on a project that involves complex
# coding, focus on writing informative comments for that code.

# There should be one-- and perferably only one --obvious way to do it.

# If two Python programmers were asked to solve the same problem, they should come up with fairly compatible solutions.
# This is not to say there's no room for creativity in programming. On the contrary! But much of programming consists
# of using small, common approaches to simple situtations within a larger, more creative project. The nuts and bolts
# of your programs should make sense to other Python programmers.

# Now is better than never.

# You could spend the rest of your life learning all the intricacies of Python and of programming in general, but then
# you''d never complete any projects. Don't try to write perfect code; write code that works, and then decide wheter to
# improve your code for that project or move on to something new.

# As you continue to the next chapter and start digging into more topics, try to keep this philosophy of simplicity and
# clarity in mind. Experienced programmers will respect your code more and will be happy to give you feedback and
# collaborate with you on interesting projects.
