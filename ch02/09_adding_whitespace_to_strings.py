# In programming, whitespace refers to any nonprinting character, such as spaces, tabs, and end-of-line
# symbols. You can use whitespace to organize your output so it's easier for users to read.

# To add a tab to your text, use the character combination \t as show at:

# >>> print("Python")
# Python
# >>> print("\tPython")
#     Python

# To add a newline in a string, use the character combination \n:

# >>> print("Languages:\nPython\nC\nJavaScript")
# Languages:
# Python
# C
# JavaScript

# You can also combine tabs and newlines in a single string. The string "\n\t" tells Python to move to a
# new line, and start the next line with a tab. The following example shows how you can use a one-line
# string to generate fourlines of output:

# >>> print("Languages:\n\tPython\n\tC\n\tJavaScript")
# Languages:
#     Python
#     C
#     JavaScript

# Newlines and tabs will be very useful in the next two chapters when you want to produce many lines of
# output from just a few lines of code.

print("Itzy members:\nYeji\nYuna\nRyujin\nChaeryeong\nLia")
