# We've added a variable named message. Every variable is connected to a value, which is the information 
# associated with that variable. In this case the value is the "Hello Python world!" text.

# Adding a variable makes a litte more work for the Python interpreter. When it processes the first line, it
# associates the variable message with the "Hello Python world!" text. When it reaches the second line, it prints
# the value assocated with message to the screen.
