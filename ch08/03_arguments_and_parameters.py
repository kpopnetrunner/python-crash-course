# def greet_user(username):
#     """Display a simple greeting."""
#     print(f"Hello, {username.title()}!")
# greet_user('jesse')

# Arguments and Parameters

# In the preceeding greet_user() function, we defined greet_user() to require a
# value for the variable username. Once we called the function and gave it the
# information (a person's name), it printed the right greeting.

# The variable username in the definition of greet_user() is an example of a
# parameter, a piece of information the function needs to do its job. The value
# 'jesse' in greet_user('jesse') is an example of an argument. An argument is a
# piece of information that's passed from a function call to a function. When we
# call the function, we place the value we want the function to work with in
# parentheses. In this case the argument 'jesse' was passed to the function
# greet_user(), and the value was assigned to the paramenter username.

# NOTE

# People sometimes speak of arguments and paramenters interchangeably. Don't be
# surprised if you see the variables in a function refured to as arguments or
# the variables in a function call referred to as parameters.
